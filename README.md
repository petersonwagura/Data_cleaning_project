📊 Dataset
Brief description of the dataset — e.g.:
This dataset contains information on Supermarket Sales
Column C – City 

Column E – Product Line

...

🔍 Issues Identified in Raw Data
Missing values

Duplicated records

Inconsistent data types

Outliers

Irregular formatting (e.g., date/time, casing)

🧼 Cleaning Steps
The following steps were taken to clean the data:

Removed duplicates

Handled missing values

Removed Outliers

Drew a boxplot to chech if the outliers have been removed

Saved the cleaned dataset for further use

🛠️ Tools Used
Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy

Jupyter Notebooks

(optional: seaborn, matplotlib for visual checks)

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-cleaning-project.git
cd data-cleaning-project
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the cleaning script or open the notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook notebooks/data_cleaning.ipynb
📂 Output
The cleaned dataset is stored in the data/cleaned/ directory and is ready for analysis or modeling.

📌 Notes
Always back up the raw data before applying transformations.

Cleaning methods should be tailored depending on your downstream use case (analysis vs. ML).
